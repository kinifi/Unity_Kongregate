The biggest problem is you MUST use javascript due to Kongregate's API only allowing this. \r\n\r\nHow to Use: \r\n- Attach the Kongregate.js script to whatever object you want. I chose an empty and named it \"KongregateAPI\"\r\n\r\nQ & A: \r\n\r\n1. Q: I want to change how things are displayed on screen how do I do that? \r\n    A: The GUILayout.Label variables must stay in order to be displayed correctly but you can change the GUILayout.BeginArea and its size to make it look however you want. \r\n\r\n2. Q: Can I do this in C#? \r\n    A: No, Kongregate does not allow you to do this because they wrote their API mostly for native games and/or flash games. \r\n\r\n3. Q: Can I submit my own Highscores? \r\n    A: Yes, just use the variables in the SubmitStatistic function. \r\n\r\n4. Q: Why are my highscores not posting in my game? \r\n    A: Kongregate needs a minimum amount of data before it can be displayed. The best is to just play it a few times and get enough data and it will eventually show up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
